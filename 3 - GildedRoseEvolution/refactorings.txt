refactorings were made to improve the readability and functionality of the code
but also following oop principles.
by using itemInterface, we eliminate the need to modify the item class 
(as per exercise guidelines) making it easier if we want to add more items later,
so the class item can then use this interface. some methods were changed so each item
'knows' how to update its own quality. encapsulation principles were still followed
by using the class item adapter . making the whole program more understandable
and scalable for the future.
